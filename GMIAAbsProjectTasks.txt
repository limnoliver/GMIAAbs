GMIA absorbance/dyes task

1. Gather data
 -Aqualog [Sam completed import of newer data - revised formatAbsSamplesRevised to work with new data]
 -W.Q. data
 -DOC data
 
2. Process data
 -Extract needed absorbance data

3. Merge data
 -W.Q. + Aualog + DOC
 -Double check that all data is present
   -If there is Aqualog data, there should be W.Q. and DOC data.
   -There will be W.Q. data when there is not associated Aqualog and DOC data


   
4. Data analysis: regressions
 -Response variables: 
   COD
   BOD
   Propylene Glycol (PG)
   sum of triazoles: 4-methyl + 5-methyl
   Acetate
   multivariate: PG and Acetate
   
 -IVs
   Signals used previously are:
	All absorbance columns: we shold revisit this with consideration of the quality of data with wvlngth > 400
	Spectral slopes (Sag): file = SagVals.csv
	Residuals: Defined towards the bottom of the absDataPrep.R script. Currently using 491, 422, and 629. We should revisit this and consider other wavelengths.
 
 -Regression
	LASSO regression for initial variable selection followed by 
	Tobit regression (censored value regression) using the survival package
	  -this is a slight deviation from Jessica's scripts
	  -Lasso regression used previously is in this script: A-LassoGMIA.R
		This script runs adaptive lasso for defined response and IVs, then routes results into a censored regression (Tobit regression using the censReg package). I would like to get away from the censReg package and use the survival package for this.
		-example of survival package use for censored environmental data analysis is here: 
			
			# response = data for response variable. censored = boolean for censored or uncensored, type = left censored.
			library(survival)
			y <- Surv(response, censored, type="left") 			
			form <- formula(paste('y ~',paste(IVs,collapse=' + ')))
			msurv <- survreg(form,data=dfPred)
			summary(msurv)
			
		-It will be valuable to do a stepwise regression using the LASSO variables in this Tobit regression, and 
		examine the added value of each variable--see below for graphics to help with this.
			
	* Discussion needed on exact approach for these regressions going forward
   
 -Generate graphics for each regression similar to CODcens_plotSteps.pdf
	Enables us to evaluate the added value of each extra variable
