GMIA absorbance/dyes task

1. Gather data
 -Aqualog
 -W.Q. data
 -DOC data
 
2. Process data
 -Extract needed absorbance data

3. Merge data
 -W.Q. + Aualog + DOC
 -Double check that all data is present
   -If there is Aqualog data, there should be W.Q. and DOC data.
   -There will be W.Q. data when there is not associated Aqualog and DOC data


   
4. Data analysis: regressions
 -Response variables: 
   COD
   BOD
   Propylene Glycol (PG)
   sum of triazoles: 4-methyl + 5-methyl
   Acetate
   multivariate: PG and Acetate
   
 -IVs
   Signals used previously are:
	All absorbance columns: we shold revisit this with consideration of the quality of data with wvlngth > 400
	Spectral slopes (Sag): file = SagVals.csv
	Residuals: Defined towards the bottom of the absDataPrep.R script. Currently using 491, 422, and 629. We should revisit this and consider other wavelengths.
 
 -Regression
	LASSO regression for initial variable selection followed by 
	Tobit regression (censored value regression) using the survival package
	  -this is a slight deviation from Jessica's scripts.
